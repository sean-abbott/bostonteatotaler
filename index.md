# Welcome to the Boston Tea Totaler

Hello! My name is Alexis, and I'm a tea drinker. I have a husband, who likes to drink...just about everything else. I used to drink, I still steal sips from him, but my body doesn't love it when I have more than about 3 sips. But I still love going to bars! And bar like places where they mostly serve alcohol. So what's a woman to do?

Whelp...I like to drink tea. And, if they're not just sugar water, zero proofs or mocktails. On occasion I'll even order a session cocktail. So this blog is to help me chronicle, track, and encourage bars to have tipples for folks like me!
